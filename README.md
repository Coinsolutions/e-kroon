I need programming power, soo if you wanna help me, just pm.
1.miner.js done
2.rock.php done, send info about the miners to coinbase.
3.coinbase.php - Needs user-enviroment to use the coin with statical money that moves in time and gains value.
  3.1. Needs to analyze prefix requests from rocks and calculate rock timepower based on requests per rock.
  3.2. Needs to split block into coins if x amount of timepower is gained over block lifespan.
4. Coin can be apply'd with freehosting services, no extra resources and this means it cant be taken down.
5. Work in time, means energy soo every part of the scheme needs to earn % of transmited traffic.
# E-kroon
E-Currency with expiring date and mining algorythm is based on session time spent on website.
# If money is transacted it gains value.
Because time in internet costs energy, that will be base of the currency.
# Time = Money
# Miner generates Timepower
# Blocks = Timepower
# If block is mined, E-kroon's are rewarded.
# If E-kroons are not used they expire, but if traided gain timepower aka lifespan.
Just invest or exchange.
Im open to ideas randma.martti@gmail.com
Soo only the coinbase with the most trade is valuable.
