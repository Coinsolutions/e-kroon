1.miner.js done<p>
2.rock.php done, send info about the miners to coinbase.<p>
3.coinbase.php - Needs user-enviroment to use the coin with statical money that moves in time and gains value.<p>
  3.1. Needs to analyze prefix requests from rocks and calculate rock timepower based on requests per rock.<p>
  3.2. Needs to split block into coins if x amount of timepower is gained over block lifespan.<p>
4. Coin can be apply'd with freehosting services, no extra resources and this means it cant be taken down.<p>
5. Work in time, means energy soo every part of the scheme needs to earn % of transmited traffic.<p>
# E-kroon
E-Currency with expiring date and mining algorythm is based on session time spent on website.
# If money is transacted it gains value.
Because time in internet costs energy, that will be base of the currency.
# Time = Money
# Miner generates Timepower
# Blocks = Timepower
# If block is mined, E-kroon's are rewarded.
# If E-kroons are not used they expire, but if traided gain timepower aka lifespan.
Just invest or exchange.
Im open to ideas randma.martti@gmail.com
Soo only the coinbase with the most trade is valuable.
