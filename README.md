# E-kroon
E-Currency with expiring date and mining algorythm is based on session time spent on website.
# If money is transacted it gains value.
Because time in internet costs energy, that will be base of the currency.
# Time = Money
Miner generates Timepower
Blocks = Timepower
If block is mined, E-kroon's are rewarded.
If E-kroons are not used they expire, but if traided gain timepower aka lifespan.
Just invest or exchange.
